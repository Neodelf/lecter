There are a lot of people around developing web apps also as new developers on projects. Sometimes they don't know how app works and which exactly processes work.
That gem will help them to understand which code executes per request.
 

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
group :development do
  gem 'lecter', git: 'https://github.com/neodelf/lecter'
end
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

## Usage


1. Use multithreading server such like a `puma` with workers more than `1`.
2. Precompile `lecter.css lecter.js` assets.
3. Add routes in your `routes.rb`

    ```ruby
    mount Lecter::Engine => '/lecter'
    ```

4. Go to `/lecter/diagnosis/new` and fill fields:

    `endpoint` - use absolute route like `localhost:3000/blogs`
 
    `params` - parameters which will be handled on request
 
    `method` - choose one variant

Examples to use
 1. `POST` method:
 
    `endpoint` - `localhost:3000/posts`
    
    `params` - `"post"=>{"title"=>"New title", "description"=>"Desciption"}`
    
    `method` - `POST`

  </p>

 2. `GET` method:
 
    `endpoint` - `localhost:3000/posts`

    `params` - empty field

    `method` - `GET`
